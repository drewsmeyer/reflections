When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

The obvious situation when I would want to use a remote repository is when I
want to backup my project. This way if I break my computer, the commmits of the
project will still be intact. Also, if I was collaborating with others, I would
want my collaborators to be able to access the project; this would be hard to
do if everything was stored just locally.
