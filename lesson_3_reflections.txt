When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	The obvious situation when I would want to use a remote repository is when I 
	want to backup my project. This way, if I break my computer, the commmits of 
	my project will still be intact. Also, if I was collaborating with others, I 
	would want my collaborators to be able to access the project; this would be 
	hard to do if everything was stored just locally.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I might not want my local repository to be updated if others can update/edit
	the remote repository. I might want to look at the changes and/or discuss 
	the updates with the individual.
