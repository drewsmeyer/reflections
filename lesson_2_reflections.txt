files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It identifies a particular directory as a Git repository. This needs to be
	done because Git will not automatically treat a directory as a repository,
	and thus will not track any file in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area comprises files that will be made into a single commit.
	These files can be just some of the files that are in the directory. Also, 
	the repository is the collection of all the commits that are formed. The 
	staging area is useful because it allows you to pick and choose exactly 
	which files you want to track as a single unit, not just all the files in a 
	given directory.
