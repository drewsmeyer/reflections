What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It identifies a particular directory as a Git repository. This needs to be
	done because Git will not automatically treat a directory as a repository,
	and thus will not track any file in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area comprises files that will be made into a single commit.
	These files can be just some of the files that are in the directory. Also, 
	the repository is the collection of all the commits that are formed. The 
	staging area is useful because it allows you to pick and choose exactly 
	which files you want to track as a single unit, not just all the files in a 
	given directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

	After I have made one logical change, I can add the updated files to the
	staging area, then create a new commit. In the case that I have made more
	than one logical change, I can add just the files corresponding to the one
	logical change, if there is no overlap, and commit those files. Next I can
	repeat this process for the other logical changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	
	Branches are helpful when you are writing code for a new feature of a 
	program, but when you are still unsure if it will be added or you currently
	don't want to update the official version. Branches allow you to create an
	unofficial version of the code to which commits can be added, but allows you
	to keep the official version of the code unchanged.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	The diagrams make it easy to see both the order in which commits are created
	and the position of all the branches with respect to each other.
